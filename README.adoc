= weechat-gnome-screensaver-away

Set away status in weechat based on GNOME ScreenSaver status.

The current implementation expects the dbus-python library to be
 installed, which it uses to query the status of the GNOME ScreenSaver
 every 5 seconds.  A future iteration could maybe listen for the D-Bus
 signals related to this state change, rather than continuously
 polling.
